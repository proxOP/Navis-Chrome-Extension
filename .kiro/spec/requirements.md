# Navis - Requirements Specification

## Project Overview
**Don't just browse. Arrive.**

Navis is a voice-driven AI navigation agent implemented as a Chrome extension that helps users navigate websites by understanding their goals and guiding them step-by-step to their destination using a hybrid DOM-intelligence and structured planning architecture.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
- **Voice Input**: Speech-to-text conversion for natural language goal expression
- **Intent Understanding**: AI-powered parsing of user goals into actionable navigation intents
- **Semantic Element Detection**: Advanced semantic analysis of DOM elements using intent-aware scoring
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Continuous improvement through human feedback and success/failure patterns
- **Adaptive Action Selection**: Smart element selection based on semantic relevance and learned preferences
- **Guided Navigation**: Step-by-step guidance with visual highlighting and user confirmation
- **Vision Fallback**: Computer vision backup for edge cases where semantic analysis fails

### User Interaction Flow
1. User activates Navis (voice command or button)
2. User states their goal in natural language
3. Navis parses intent and extracts semantic requirements
4. Semantic analyzer scores all page elements for relevance
5. RL system applies learned preferences and patterns
6. Navis presents top action candidates with confidence scores
7. User confirms action or provides feedback for learning
8. System executes action and learns from success/failure
9. Vision fallback activates if semantic approach fails

### Element Detection Capabilities
- **Semantic Analysis**: Intent-aware element scoring using text content, ARIA labels, context, and positioning
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Continuous improvement from user feedback and interaction success patterns
- **Multi-layered Matching**: Text matching, semantic matching, context matching, and visual positioning
- **Confidence Scoring**: Probabilistic ranking of action candidates with uncertainty quantification
- **Adaptive Learning**: Personalization based on user preferences and domain-specific patterns
- **Fallback (Vision-based)**: Screenshot analysis for visual-only elements when semantic approach fails

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Intent parsing response time < 2 seconds
- Semantic element analysis < 1 second for typical pages
- Action candidate scoring < 500ms
- RL model inference < 100ms
- Visual feedback response < 100ms
- Total goal-to-action time < 4 seconds
- Memory usage < 50MB per tab
- Learning model updates < 200ms

### Cost Efficiency
- Semantic analysis performed locally (no API costs)
- Reinforcement learning runs locally with minimal compute
- LLM calls only for intent parsing (1 call per user goal)
- Vision fallback used only when necessary (< 5% of cases)
- Learning from human feedback reduces future errors

### Reliability
- Semantic understanding provides human-like element selection
- Reinforcement learning improves accuracy over time
- Confidence scoring enables smart fallback decisions
- Human feedback loop ensures continuous improvement
- Graceful degradation when semantic analysis insufficient
- Automatic fallback to vision-based approach for edge cases

### Security & Privacy
- No credential storage or access
- No background or invisible actions
- All actions require user confirmation for sensitive operations
- Session-scoped operation only (no persistent data)

### Accessibility
- Compatible with screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast visual indicators
- Configurable voice settings

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome extension manifest v3
- Support for modern web standards
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features

## Constraints & Limitations

### Intentional Scope Limitations
- **Single Tab Operation**: Works only within current browser tab
- **Domain Restriction**: No cross-domain navigation
- **No Credential Access**: Cannot access stored passwords or authentication
- **No Autonomous Submissions**: Requires confirmation for form submissions

## LLM Architecture Requirements

### Semantic Search + Reinforcement Learning Approach

The system uses a **Semantic Element Detection + Reinforcement Learning** approach for intelligent action selection:

#### Why Semantic Search + RL:
- **Human-like Understanding**: Semantic analysis mimics how humans identify relevant elements
- **Continuous Improvement**: RL learns from successes, failures, and human feedback
- **Fast Execution**: Local semantic analysis with minimal API calls
- **Personalization**: Adapts to individual user preferences and patterns
- **Domain Learning**: Builds expertise for specific website types over time

#### Why Not Pure MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search):
- **Computationally Expensive**: Requires many simulations for each decision
- **Ignores Semantics**: Treats elements as abstract nodes without meaning
- **Slow for Real-time**: Multiple seconds of planning per action
- **No Learning**: Doesn't improve from past experiences

#### Why Not Pure Vision Approach:
- **High Cost**: Vision API calls cost 10-20x more than text
- **Slow Performance**: Image processing adds 3-5 seconds per action
- **Hallucination Risk**: Vision models can misinterpret UI elements
- **Resource Intensive**: Screenshots and processing consume significant bandwidth

### Chosen Architecture Benefits:
- **Fast**: Single LLM call for intent + local semantic analysis
- **Smart**: Understands element meaning and context
- **Learning**: Improves accuracy through RL and human feedback
- **Cheap**: 95% cost reduction vs vision-only approaches
- **Reliable**: Semantic understanding + learned preferences

### LLM Integration Strategy:
1. **Intent Parsing**: Single call to understand user goal and extract semantic requirements
2. **Semantic Analysis**: Local processing to score elements based on intent relevance
3. **RL Decision**: Apply learned preferences to select best action candidate
4. **Feedback Learning**: Update RL model based on action success and human feedback
5. **Vision Fallback**: Only when semantic approach fails (< 5% cases)
